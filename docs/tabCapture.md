## Description

Use the`chrome.tabCapture`API to interact with tab media streams.

<br />

<br />

## Permissions

`tabCapture`  

<br />

<br />

<br />

## Concepts and usage

The chrome.tabCapture API lets you access a[`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaStream)containing video and audio of the current tab. It can only be called after the user invokes an extension, such as by clicking the extension's[action button](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop#actions). This is similar to the behavior of the[`"activeTab"`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab)permission.

### Preserve system audio

When a[`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaStream)is obtained for a tab, audio in that tab will no longer be played to the user. This is similar to the behavior of the[`getDisplayMedia()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia)function when the[`suppressLocalAudioPlayback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackSupportedConstraints/suppressLocalAudioPlayback)flag is set to true.

To continue playing audio to the user, use the following:  

    const output = new AudioContext();
    const source = output.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
    source.connect(output.destination);

This creates a new`AudioContext`and connects the audio of the tab's`MediaStream`to the default destination.

### Stream IDs

Calling[`chrome.tabCapture.getMediaStreamId()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#method-getMediaStreamId)will return a stream ID. To later access a[`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaStream)from the ID, use the following:  

    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
      audio: {
        mandatory: {
          chromeMediaSource: "tab",
          chromeMediaSourceId: id,
        },
      },
      video: {
        mandatory: {
          chromeMediaSource: "tab",
          chromeMediaSourceId: id,
        },
      },
    });

### Usage restrictions

After calling[`getMediaStreamId()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#method-getMediaStreamId), there are restrictions on where the returned stream ID can be used:

- If`consumerTabId`is specified, the ID can be used by a`getUserMedia()`call in any frame in the given tab which has the same security origin.
- When this is not specified, beginning in Chrome 116, the ID can be used in any frame with the same security origin in the same render process as the caller. This means that a stream ID obtained in a service worker can be used in an[offscreen document](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/offscreen).

Prior to Chrome 116, when a`consumerTabId`was not specified, the stream ID was restricted to both the security origin, render process and render frame of the caller.

To learn more about how to use the`chrome.tabCapture`API, see[Audio recording and screen capture](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/how-to/web-platform/screen-capture). This demonstrates how to use`tabCapture`and related APIs to solve a number of common use cases.

## Types

### CaptureInfo

#### Properties

  - fullscreen  
  boolean

  Whether an element in the tab being captured is in fullscreen mode.
  - status  
  [TabCaptureState](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#type-TabCaptureState)

  The new capture status of the tab.
  - tabId  
  number

The id of the tab whose status changed.  

### CaptureOptions

#### Properties

  - audio  
  booleanoptional
  - audioConstraints  
  [MediaStreamConstraint](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#type-MediaStreamConstraint)optional
  - video  
  booleanoptional
  - videoConstraints  
[MediaStreamConstraint](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#type-MediaStreamConstraint)optional  

### GetMediaStreamOptions

Chrome 71+  

#### Properties

  - consumerTabId  
  numberoptional

  Optional tab id of the tab which will later invoke`getUserMedia()`to consume the stream. If not specified then the resulting stream can be used only by the calling extension. The stream can only be used by frames in the given tab whose security origin matches the consumber tab's origin. The tab's origin must be a secure origin, e.g. HTTPS.
  - targetTabId  
  numberoptional

Optional tab id of the tab which will be captured. If not specified then the current active tab will be selected. Only tabs for which the extension has been granted the`activeTab`permission can be used as the target tab.  

### MediaStreamConstraint

#### Properties

  - mandatory  
  object
  - optional  
objectoptional  

### TabCaptureState

#### Enum

"pending"  
"active"  
"stopped"  
"error"  

<br />

## Methods

### capture()

Foreground only

```typescript
chrome.tabCapture.capture(
  options: CaptureOptions,
  callback: function,
): void
```

Captures the visible area of the currently active tab. Capture can only be started on the currently active tab after the extension has been*invoked* , similar to the way that[activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/activeTab#invoking-activeTab)works. Capture is maintained across page navigations within the tab, and stops when the tab is closed, or the media stream is closed by the extension.  

#### Parameters

  - options  
  [CaptureOptions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#type-CaptureOptions)

  Configures the returned media stream.
  - callback  
  function

  The`callback`parameter looks like:  

  ```typescript
  (stream: LocalMediaStream) => void
  ```

  <br />

    - stream  
LocalMediaStream  

### getCapturedTabs()

```typescript
chrome.tabCapture.getCapturedTabs(): Promise<https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#type-CaptureInfo[]>
```

Returns a list of tabs that have requested capture or are being captured, i.e. status != stopped and status != error. This allows extensions to inform the user that there is an existing tab capture that would prevent a new tab capture from succeeding (or to prevent redundant requests for the same tab).  

#### Returns

  - Promise\<[CaptureInfo](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#type-CaptureInfo)\[\]\>  
Chrome 116+  

### getMediaStreamId()

Chrome 71+

```typescript
chrome.tabCapture.getMediaStreamId(
  options?: GetMediaStreamOptions,
): Promise<string>
```

Creates a stream ID to capture the target tab. Similar to chrome.tabCapture.capture() method, but returns a media stream ID, instead of a media stream, to the consumer tab.  

#### Parameters

  - options  
[GetMediaStreamOptions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#type-GetMediaStreamOptions)optional  

#### Returns

  - Promise\<string\>  
  Chrome 116+

## Events

### onStatusChanged

```typescript
chrome.tabCapture.onStatusChanged.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Event fired when the capture status of a tab changes. This allows extension authors to keep track of the capture status of tabs to keep UI elements like page actions in sync.  

#### Parameters

  - callback  
  function

  The`callback`parameter looks like:  

  ```typescript
  (info: CaptureInfo) => void
  ```

  <br />

    - info  
    [CaptureInfo](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture#type-CaptureInfo)

<br />
